distance(m) = 10 ^ (((-59)-RSSI)/(10*2.0))

// RSSI = Received signal strength (dBm)
// -59 = RSSI value measured at a distance of 1 meter (dBm)
// 2.0 = Path loss exponent

## Test and Analyze

### Why is there a slight difference with the model

1. **Environmental Factors**
1. Multipath Propagation
2. Signal Absorption
3. Signal Interference
2. **Model Simplification**
1. Although the model set pathLossExponent to a fixed value (2.0), it can vary in the range of 1.6 to 3.5 in real-world environments.
3. ** Volatility of BLE signal (BLE Signal Fluctuation)**
1. The BLE signal fluctuates over time.
2. Therefore, it is more accurate to use the average value after multiple measurements, rather than a single sample.
